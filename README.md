- Starts in the last week of every cycle.
- This first one will start with the selection round starting EOD Wednesday the 6th

**Current monthly budget for RFPs $120,000**
Max 70,000 DAI – approximately $70,000

## Overview

    * Importance Survey (Start)
    * RFP Submissions
    * Bid Submissions
* Collate (final day of open submissions)
* Day 1 Selection Round
* Day 2 Negotiation Round
* Day 3 Ratification Round

### Open Submissions Round

#### Importance Survey
A new importance survey will go out to help inform the submission process. The results of this survey can be used to inform RFPs and strengthen the bids.

##### RFP submissions
* Any member can submit a RFP, it should follow the [template here](https://hackmd.io/@daohaus/H1M3Ml_q9) and state which objectives from the importance survey the RFP tries to address.
* RFPs are submitted to the forum and should follow the template
* add a RFP number sequential to last submitted RFP (ex. RFP001, RFP002)
* Discussion can happen on the forum, members/bidders can request clarifications or changes.
* A RFP must have 2 hearts from members to be considered valid.

#### Bid Submissions
* A bid can be submitted at any time as a reply to the OPs RFP.
* A bid should address the Submission Requirements section of the RFP
* A bid should have 2 hearts from members to be considered valid

#### Collate 
RFPs and Bids moved to github issues

### Selection Round
Token weighted choice, this is done off chain, initially just with a google form and a list of open bids. Each member gets 100 points to allocate
* 1 day open ranking period
* Results are normalized with members shares
* Evaluate on importance to the DAO and ROI vs budget requested
* Can not do the same number of points on multiple projects (ties are not what we are going for)

### Negotiation Round
Time boxed period to smooth out any edge cases.
* The top ranked bids that fit inside the budget are prioritized to move to on chain ratification.
* Successful bids can negotiate with each other if there is overlap or shared resources
* If there is a ranked bid that pushes the total over the budget then in this period is where the bidder can negotiate with the winners or lower its ask to make it in the budget. 
* Budgets on the winning RFPs can only stay the same or go down through negotiations.
* In the case of gridlock on the proposal, the bid is closed  and the budget is forwarded to next month 

### Ratification Round
Winning bids are moved to on-chain ratification and funds are dispersed.  
* proposal is required to pass as the ranking and negotiations was done off chain
* All remaining bids are closed. 
    * They can be reassessed and reopened by a current member in the next round if wanted.
