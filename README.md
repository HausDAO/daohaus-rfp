## Monthly Resource Allocation

### 1. DAOhaus Objective Signaling (medium run)
> “What is most important to accomplish within the next year?”

To make effective progress against its long-term mission, DAOhaus needs to establish a set of medium-term Objectives that it will focus on achieving over the medium run (3-12 months, i.e. 1-4 seasons). 

These Objectives and their relative importance should be set by the DAO. While they are unlikely to change often, they should be adjustable over time as certain Objectives are achieved and as conditions change. 

This bottom-up, fluid, and adaptive signal of relative Objective importance creates a higher level guide for how the DAO as a collective and individual members choose to allocate their resources, time, and attention.

1. DAO members nominate candidate Objectives to establish an initial list
    - Objectives must follow the DAOhaus Objective Template
    - Objectives are submitted as github issues, and then added to the Objectives spreadsheet
2. DAO members are given medium term importance points in proportion to their Warcamp DAO shares, which they allocate across the Objectives on the list
    - Members should allocate their importance points according to what they currently think is most important to accomplish over the next year
    - Allocations are entered in the Objectives spreadsheet
3. On an ongoing basis – ie at any time – DAO members can…
    - Nominate new objectives, if they feel any are missing
    - Reallocate their medium term importance points to reflect their current perspective
4. Nomination and allocation is open and continuous, spanning across months and Seasons
5. Each month, there is a freeze on nomination and allocation beginning at day -5 and ending once bids are selected (ie day 2)

> NOTE: DAO share-weighted importance represents relative importance, not binary priority selection. For example, it is not the case that the Objective with the highest allocation of importance is necessarily the only Objective that should be prioritized over the medium run. 

### 2. Project Importance Signaling (short run)
> “What is most important to accomplish right now?”

To make effective progress against its medium-term Objectives, DAOhaus needs to identify a set of outcomes and outputs that it will focus on delivering over the short run (1-3 months, i.e. within a single season). 

These outcomes, outputs, and deliverables are known as Projects. Like the Objectives, Projects and their relative importance should be set by the DAO. Their relative importance should change more often than that of Objectives.

This bottom-up, fluid, and adaptive signal of relative Project importance creates a lower level guide for how the DAO as a collective and individual members choose to allocate their resources, time, and attention.

1. Each month, DAO members nominate candidate Projects for that month
    - Projects should align with DAOhaus objectives, though this is not a strict requirement
    - Projects must follow the Project Template
    - Projects are submitted as github issues, and then added to the Project Spreadsheet
2. DAO members are given short term importance points in proportion to their Warcamp DAO shares, which they allocate across the Projects on the list
    - Members should allocate their importance points according to what they think is most important to work on in the coming month
    - Allocations are entered in the Projects spreadsheet
3. Over a 2-day period, DAO members can…
    - Nominate new Projects to the list
    - Allocate (or reallocate) their short term importance points across Projects to reflect their current perspective
4. Nominations can begin prior to the period
5. After the period is over, no new Projects can be nominated, but importance allocation can be adjusted

> NOTE: DAO share-weighted importance represents relative importance, not binary priority selection. For example, it is not the case that the Project with the highest allocation of importance is necessarily the only Project that should be prioritized.

### 3. Bid Submission
Guided by these high quality signals, contributors now bid to complete the prioritized Projects.

1. Bids must follow the Bid Template, and be…
    - Complete
    - Clear
    - Actionable
    - Within the available monthly budget
    - Not malicious
    - Strongly Suggested: Applicable to at least one DAOhaus Objective with signal
    - Strongly Suggested: Applicable to at least one Project with signal 
        - Bids can span multiple Projects
        - Bids can partially address a Project
2. Bids are submitted as github issues
3. Over a 2-day period, contributors make their bids.
     - As they observe other bids, they can use the 2 days to identify potential conflicts and overlaps, and to merge, diverge, or decide to compete head on with those other bids.
4. During this period, a Facilitator is responsible for helping bid teams…
    - Parse overlaps and potential conflicts among bids
    - Create interface points among bids
    - Facilitate merging and diverging of bids

### 4. Bid Selection
Once bids have been submitted, the DAO then chooses which bids to fund.

1. Final bids are put up to a Snapshot vote, using Warcamp DAO shares and the “Weighted Voting” strategy
2. DAO members have 2 days to vote
3. Once the voting period is over, the top bids that fit into the monthly budget (+ buffer) are selected for funding
4. Budget for the selected bids is entered into an omnibus DAO funding proposal(s) for payout

## Monthly Evaluation
## 5. Project Reflection / Evaluation
Share-weighted allocation of value created (coordinape style) to each project

## 6. Contributor Reflection
1. Each selected bid team outputs a value created proportional score for each person that contributed to that team’s work
    - Teams can use whatever method for doing this that they like – eg coordinape, team lead decides, whatever – as long as they generate the necessary output
2. Integration
    - Contributor::work-chunk scores are weighted by the work chunk scores
    - Contributor scores across chunks are summed to get to one score per contributor
3. Bonus payment: each month, contributors receive a proportional amount of 600 HAUS, based on their contributor reflection score

## Cadence

### Season Cadence
A single Season spans three months. 

The primary purpose for Seasons is as a container for a stable monthly budget. 

### Monthly Cadence

Day 1 is the start of a new month.
